                        Welcome to my portfolio page where I aim to showcase some of my work I have done. I am currently taking part in a 24-week full-stack bootcamp through Michigan State University. I look forward to absorbing everything I can about web-development.

                        My ultimate goal is to help solve the unemployment issues faced by many African countries by teaching young Africans how to code. Once they are well-versed in coding, I will work to link them up with American and European countries searching for programmers.
